# CG-MINI-PROJECT
The project aims to implement the rendering of a Sierpinski Pyramid using the GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) library in the field of computer graphics. The Sierpinski Pyramid is a fractal structure characterized by its self-similarity and recursive construction. The project focuses on creating an interactive 3D visualization of the pyramid using GLUT's graphics capabilities.
This includes initializing the GLUT window, defining the viewport, and setting up the necessary callbacks for handling user interactions. The pyramid is constructed using a recursive algorithm. The base pyramid is defined, and then the algorithm recursively divides each face into smaller pyramids until the desired level of detail is achieved. This fractal structure provides an intriguing visual representation.
